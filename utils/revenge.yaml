  # Running Experiments

  All circuits from the paper are located in the `experiments/benchmarks`
  directory. Circuits for the components can be found in `experiments/pattern`.
  In order to check whether a component is contained in a block one can, e.g.,
  run

      build/programs/find_subcircuit --target experiments/benchmarks/c1-16.aag --pattern experiments/pattern/mult-16.aag --vectors ah,1c,2h --method 6 -v

  This checks whether a 16-bit multiplier is contained in `c1-16` using all-hot,
  one-cold, and two-hot as simulation vectors and the LAD based algorithm using
  structural support constraints.  More information on how to use the program is
  printed when calling

      build/programs/find_subcircuit -h

  Some tools need to be installed in order to run all algorithms successfully.
  They can be installed using the package manager:

      utils/tools.py install abc
      utils/tools.py install directed_lad
      utils/tools.py install minisat
      utils/tools.py install aiger

  In order to enable the programs to find the tools, extend the system's `PATH`
  variable with

      export PATH=`pwd`/ext/bin:$PATH

  from the main directory of Revenge.
