\noindent Let $f$ be a Boolean function on $n$ variables and $U$ be a unity
matrix for which an integer $k>1$ exists such that $U^k=I$.  We are interested
in decomposing the controlled quantum gate

into a sequence of controlled $U$ gates, however, each control function of these
gates must be representable as a single product term (possibly with negative
literals).  This problem has a close relationship to disjoint sum-of-product
representations.

A cube is a Boolean function that can be expressed as $x_{i_1}^{p_1}\land
x_{i_2}^{p_2}\land\cdots\land x_{i_k}^{p_k}$ for some $k$, where $x^0=\bar x$
and $x^1=x$.  Any Boolean function can be expressed as a cube set
$C=\{c_1,c_2,\dots,c_m\}$, i.e.
$$ f(x_1,\dots,x_n)=c_1\lor c_2\lor\cdots\lor c_m. \eqno(2) $$
The formula is often also referred to as sum-of-product representation or
disjunctive normal form.  We will use the terms cube set and sum-of-product
representation synomymously.  The on-set of a function $f$, denoted ${\rm
on}(f)$, contains all vectors $x$ such that $f(x)=1$.  A cube set $C$ for a
function $f$ is {\it disjoint\/} if and only if
$$ |\{c \in C \mid c(x)=1 \}|=1 \qquad\hbox{for all $x\in{\rm on}(f)$}. \eqno(3) $$
We can also say that for each assignment from the on set, only one cube can be
{\it active\/} at the same time, a concept that can be generalized as follows.
Given a set $M\subseteq\{1,\dots,2^n\}$ a cube set $C$ is called $M$-{\it active},
if and only if
$$ |\{c \in C \mid c(x)=1 \}|\in M \qquad\hbox{for all $x\in{\rm on}(f)$}. \eqno(4) $$

\smallskip\noindent{\bf Theorem 1.} Let $f$ be a Boolean function and $U$ be a
unitary matrix as given in (1).  Then it can be decomposed into a circuit where
each gate corresponds to cube from an $M$-active cube set of $f$, with
$M=\{1,k+1,2k+1,3k+1,\dots\}$.

\noindent Given a Boolean function $f$ represented as a set of cubes $C=\{c_1,
c_2, \dots, c_m\}$ a decomposition
$$ f = b_1 \lor b_2 \lor \cdots \lor b_p \eqno(3) $$
can be found where the $b_i$'s have the following property: for all assignments
$x\in{\rm on}(b_i)$, the number of asserting cubes is $i$.  Furthermore, we
require that $b_q\neq\bot$.  It is easy to see that $b_i \land b_j = \bot$ for
all $i\neq j$.  We call such a decomposition {\it active set decomposition}.  It
is always unique with respect to the cube set and can be generated using the
following algorithm.

\item{1.}  Set $i\leftarrow 1$ and $p\leftarrow 0$.  ($p$ is the same index as
in (3) and is increasing while the algorithm runs.)

\item{2.}  For $j=1,\dots,q$ perform step 3.

\item{3.}  Let $b=b_j$ and set $b_j\leftarrow b\oplus c_i$, and $c_i\leftarrow
b\land c_i$.

\item{4.}  If $c_i \neq \bot$, set $p \leftarrow p + 1$ and $b_p \leftarrow
c_i$.

\item{5.}  If $i<m$, set $i\leftarrow i + 1$ and return to step 1; otherwise
terminate.

\medskip\noindent The algorithm constructs all $b_i$'s in (3) by going through
all cubes.  Then with each cube the list of all existing $b_i$'s \dots

\noindent {\bf Theorem 2.}  Let $f$ be a Boolean function represented as a set
of cubes $C$ and an active set decomposition $b_1\lor b_2\lor \cdots\lor b_q$
and let $D_i$ be a DSOP representation for $b_i$.  Then the active set
decomposition of $f$ with respect to $C\cup D_i$ is
$$ b_1 \lor b_2 \lor \cdots \lor b_i' \lor b_{i+1}' \lor \cdots \lor b_q $$
with $b_i' = \bot$ and $b_{i+1}'=b_i \lor b_{i+1}$.  We have $b_{q+1}=\bot$ for
the corner case $i=q$.
