\noindent{\bf 1. Self-inverse functions.}\enspace A reversible function is
called {\it self-inverse\/} if $f(f(x))=x$ for all input assignments $x$, or in
other words if $f=f^{-1}$.  It helps a lot to investigate the respective
permutations that are represented by the reversible functions, i.e.~elements
from the symmetric group $S_{2^n}$.  Then, self-inverse functions correspond to
self-conjugate permutations that are also often called {\it involutions\/} in
the literature.  The permutation that represents the identity is denoted
$\pi_{\rm id}$.  The permutation matrix of an involution is symmetric.  There is
an interesting property of involutions.

\smallskip \noindent{\bf Lemma 1.} \sl Let $f$ be a self-inverse function and
$\pi_f$ its corresponding permutation.  Then, the cycle representation of
$\pi_f$ consists only of transpositions or fixpoints. \rm

\smallskip\noindent {\it Proof.} The cycle representation is unique when
disregarding order of cycles and order of elements within cycles.  Assume that
the cycle representation of $\pi_f$ consists of a cycle $(i_1\; i_2\; \ldots \;
i_k)$ with $k>2$.  Then $\pi_f^{-1}$ consists of the cycle $(i_k \; \ldots \;
i_2 \; i_1)$ and hence $\pi_f\neq \pi_f^{-1}$. \qquad\slug

\smallskip\noindent We define some special classes of self-inverse functions:

\item{--} A self-inverse function $f$ is {\it trivial\/} if $f$ is the identity
function.
\item{--} A self-inverse function $f$ is {\it simple\/} if $f$ can be realized
using a single mixed-polarity multiple-controlled Toffoli gate.
\item{--} A self-inverse function $f$ is a {\it transposition\/} if its
permutation representation $\pi_f$ is a transposition.
\item{--} A self-inverse function $f$ is called {\it palindromic\/} if the
number of cycles in its permutation representation $\pi_f$ is $2^k$ for some
nonnegative integer $k$.

\smallskip\noindent From the book of T.~Muir [{\sl A Treatise on the Theory of
Determinants\/} (1960)] we have that the number of involutions on $n$ elements
is
$$ I(n) = 1 + \sum_{k=0}^{\lceil(n-1)/2\rceil}{1\over{(k+1)!}}
          \prod_{i=0}^k\left(\matrix{ n-2i \cr 2}\right), \eqno(1) $$ or
alternatively according to S.~Skiena [{\sl Implementing Discrete Mathematics\/}
(1990)] we have
$$ I(n) = n!\sum_{k=0}^{\lceil n/2\rceil}{1\over{2^kk!(n-2k)!}}. \eqno(2) $$
The number of self-inverse functions on $n$ variables is $I(2^n)$.  From (2) it
can easily be seen that the percentage of self-inverse functions with respect to
all reversible functions is
$$ {I(2^n)\over{2^n!}} = \sum_{k=0}^{2^{n-1}}{1\over{2^kk!(2^n-2k)!}}. \eqno(3) $$
The number of simple self-inverse functions is $n\cdot3^{n-1}$ since we have $n$
choices for selecting the target line and for each of the remaining $n-1$ lines
three choices of either having it uncontrolled, positive controlled, or negative
controlled.  The number of self-inverse functions on $n$ variables that are
transpositions is $\big({{2^n}\atop 2}\big)$.  Finally, the number of
self-inverse functions on $n$ variables that are palindromic is
$$ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} {1\over{2^k!}} \prod_{i=0}^{2^k-1} \left(\matrix{2^n-2i \cr 2}\right).\eqno(4) $$

All functions that have been discussed in this section are counted in Table 1
for one to six variables.  Note that the subset relation
$$
  \hbox{reversible} \supset \hbox{self-inverse} \supset \hbox{palindromic} \supset \hbox{transpositions} \eqno(5)
$$
holds.  We have `$\hbox{simple}\not\subset\hbox{transpositions}$' but
`$\hbox{simple}\subset\hbox{palindromic}$'.

\medskip \noindent{\bf 2. Palindromic circuits.}\enspace A circuit
$C=g_1g_2\dots g_k$, which consists of mixed-polarity multiple-controlled
Toffoli gates $g_i$, is called {\it palindromic\/} if $ g_i = g_{k+1-i}$ for all
$i \in \{1,\dots,\lfloor{k\over 2}\rfloor\}$.  The circuit is called {\it
even\/} if $k$ is even and {\it odd\/} otherwise.

\smallskip \noindent{\bf Lemma 2.} \sl A palindromic circuit is even if and only
if it realizes the identity function. \rm

\smallskip\noindent {\it Proof.} Let $C=g_1g_2\dots g_{2k}$ be an even
palindromic circuit.  Then $g_{k}=g_{2k+1-k}=g_{k+1}$ and $C$ is functionally
equivalent to the circuit $g_1g_2\dots g_{k-1}g_{k+2} \dots g_{2k}$.  Again, the
two ``middle gates'' are equal and therefore we can continue this procedure
until no gates remain and we have that $C$ represents the identity function.

Now let $C=g_1g_2\dots g_kg_{k+1}g_{k+2}\dots g_{2k+1}$ be an odd palindromic
circuit and let $h$ be the function that is represented by the first $k$ gates
$g_1g_2\dots g_k$.  Since $C$ is palindromic the last $k$ gates $g_{k+2}\dots
g_{2k+1}$ represents the function $h^{-1}$.  Since $g_{k+1}$ is a Toffoli gate
there exists some $x$ such that $g_{k+1}(x)=y\neq x$.  Propagating $x$ to the
left yields $h^{-1}(x)$ at the inputs of $C$ and propagating $y$ to the right
yiels $h^{-1}(y)$ at the outputs of $C$.  Since $x\neq y$ we also have
$h^{-1}(x)\neq h^{-1}(y)$ and hence $C$ does not represent the identity
function.\qquad\slug

\noindent{\bf Lemma 3.} \sl A self-inverse function is a palindromic function if
and only if it can be realized by an odd palindromic circuit. \rm

\smallskip\noindent {\it Proof.} Given an odd palindromic circuit.  Then it
realizes a self-inverse function which permutation representation is $f\circ
g\circ f^{-1}$ with $g$ being a permutation representing a single Toffoli
gate. We know that ${\rm cyc}(g)=2^k$ for some nonnegative integer $k$.
According to Theorem 9.131 in [N.\ A.\ Loehr, {\sl Bijective Combinatorics\/}
(2011)] we have ${\rm cyc}(f\circ g\circ f^{-1}) = {\rm cyc}(g)$ and therefore
$f\circ g\circ f^{-1}$ is palindromic.

\dots \qquad\slug

% \smallskip \noindent{\bf Open question 1.} \sl Assuming that there exists a
% palindromic circuit for each self-inverse function, the question is whether
% there also exists a palindromic circuit in a V-shape for each self-inverse
% function. \rm

% \medskip\noindent{\bf 2. Connection to permutations.}\enspace

% Working with involutions, we can find an equivalent conjecture to Conjecture~1
% based on the notation of permutations.  First, we prove a further lemma.

% \smallskip\noindent{\bf Lemma 4.} \sl A permutation $\pi$ is an involution if
% and only if it can be written as $\pi = \pi_1\circ\pi_2\circ\pi_1^{-1}$ where
% $\pi_1\neq \pi_{\rm id}$ and $\pi_2\neq \pi$ is an involution. \rm

% \smallskip\noindent {\it Proof.}  Let $\pi = \pi_1\circ\pi_2\circ\pi_1^{-1}$ and
% let $\pi_1(x)=y$, $\pi_2(y)=z$, and $\pi_1^{-1}(z)=w$.  Since $\pi_2$ is an
% involution we have $\pi(x)=w$ and $\pi(w)=x$ and therefore $\pi$ is also an
% involution.

% Now assume that $\pi$ is an involution.  From the previous proof direction we
% obtain another involution $\pi_2\neq \pi$ by taking any permutation $\pi_1\neq
% \pi_{\rm id}$ by calculating $\pi_2=\pi_1\circ\pi\circ \pi_1^{-1}$.  Multiplying
% the left side of the equation with $\pi_1^{-1}$ and the right side with $\pi_1$
% we obtain $\pi=\pi_1^{-1}\circ\pi_2\circ\pi_1$, concluding the
% proof. \qquad\slug

% \smallskip\noindent {\bf Conjecture 2.} \sl Every involution $\pi$ can be
% decomposed into $\pi = \pi_1\circ \pi_g\circ \pi_1^{-1}$ where $\pi_g$ is a
% permutation that can be realized using a single Toffoli gate. \rm

% \smallskip\noindent Conjecture 2 is equivalent to Conjecture 1.

\medskip\noindent{\bf Transpositions.}\enspace Any transposition $(a,b)$ can be
realized with $2h-1$ gates where $h$ is the hamming distance between the binary
expansions of $a=a_1a_2\dots a_n$ and $b=b_1b_2\dots b_n$.  More precisely, the
circuit consists of $2(h-1)$ CNOT gates and one fully controlled Toffoli gate.
In the worst case we have $h=n$.  The circuit to represent a transposition has
the form $ABA$ and is constructed as follows: Let $i_1,\dots,i_h$ be the indexes
in which the binary expansions of $a$ and $b$ differ.  Part $A$ consists of CNOT
gates ${\rm T}(\{x_h^{a_h}\}, x_j)$ for $1\le j< h$ and part $B$ consists of the
single Toffoli gate ${\rm T}(\{x_j^{b_j}\mid j\neq h\}, x_h)$.  Note that all
gates in part $A$ can be positioned in any order and hence $A=A^{-1}$ for each
chosen order.  Given $a=001$ and $b=110$ we can choose $h \in \{1,2,3\}$ and get
the following circuits:

\smallskip\noindent{\bf Lemma 4.} \sl One requires at least $2h-1$ gates to
represent a transpositon $(a,b)$ when the hamming distance between the binary
expansion of $a$ and $b$ is $h$. \rm

\smallskip\noindent {\it Proof.} We proof it by induction on $h$.  Since $(a,b)$
is a transposition, we have $a\neq b$ and hence $h>0$.  For the base case $h=1$,
obviously at least one gate is required since otherwise the circuit realizes the
identity.  We assume that the lemma holds for $h$ and now consider the case
$h+1$.  In this case the hamming distance between $a$ and $b$ is $h+1$. \dots
