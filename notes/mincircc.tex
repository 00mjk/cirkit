\noindent{\bf 1. One-hot shift.}\enspace We are looking for minimal circuits of
$n$ lines that realize the permutation $(2^0 \; 2^1 \; \ldots \; 2^{n-1})$.  We
conjecture that the circuits have the following form illustrated for the first
$n=3,\dots,7$.

\smallskip\noindent Minimality can be shown using exhaustive search techniques
up to at least $n=9$, however, we are interested in finding a proof for all $n$.
Note that the circuit structure is in fact more general than the pictures
indicate.  The first gate must be fully negatively controlled but can have its
target line at any position.  The successive gates must have its target line at
one lower line.  If the target is at the first circuit line, then the next
target will be at last circuit line.  The first chosen gate is repeated at the
end of the circuit.
